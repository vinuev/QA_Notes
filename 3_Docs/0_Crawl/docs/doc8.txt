Read a tactical analysis here Russia have a clear gameplan and have benefited from a switch to a back three, which most players use at club level. There are also a number of good box-to-box players in the squad. Russia will sorely miss the injured striker Aleksandr Kokorin while the wing-backs are arguably too old and the centre-backs too young and inexperienced.

Read a tactical analysis here The three attacking midfielders in Pizzis 4-2-3-1  Salem al-Dawsari, Yahya al-Shehri and Fahad al-Muwallad  are talented players who will expect to test any defence in Russia.  The defence is experienced but susceptible to pace and rarely plays against the kind of top-calibre attackers you find at the World Cup.

The team need him if they are to get out of the group.  Read a tactical analysis here Hector Cuper, as always, builds his team on a solid defence and Egypt conceded only 20 goals in his first 35 games in charge.  With Mohamed Salah in a race to get fit in time for the finals, Egypt may struggle to score with Marwan Mohsen often left isolated up front.

Read a tactical analysis here The obvious strength of this team lies up front with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani forming one of the tournaments most potent partnerships. No obvious weaknesses but the left-sided midfielder Cristian Rodriguez, at 32, is not getting any quicker and that sometimes leaves the full-back Martin Caceres exposed.

Read a tactical analysis here Ronaldo is still the focal point but players such as Bernardo Silva, Andre Silva and Gelson Martins have gained more experience and are able to support him better up front. The central defence is a worry with only Pepe - who is not getting any younger - guaranteed a starting place, with Bruno Alves and Jose Fonte out of form.

Read a tactical analysis here Spain have one of the strongest squads at the World Cup, with the midfield, led by Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, David Silva, Asensio and Isco, particularly impressive. There is not a natural finisher in the squad, such as a David Villa, and Diego Costa has struggled to connect with the midfield when he has played.  Profiles written by Juan I.

Read a tactical analysis here They play with real belief under Renard and Ajaxs Hakim Ziyech is one of the most talented playmakers in Europe. The first-choice goalkeeper, Munir Mohand Mohamedi, started only one league game for Numancia in Spains second tier and is bound to be rusty.

Read a tactical analysis here Iran look far stronger up front than they did in Brazil four years ago, with players such as Sardar Azmoun, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, Karim Ansarifard and Saman Ghoddos in good form.  Central defence is a concern as Jalal Hosseini has been dropped, with Queiroz seemingly undecided about who is going to partner Morteza Pouraliganji.

Read a tactical analysis here The attack is simply frightening with players such as Anthony Martial and Alexandre Lacazette not even making the squad. Three out of Antoine Griezmann, Kylian Mbappe, Olivier Giroud and Thomas Lemar will start up front.  Lack of consistency - they lost to Sweden and drew with Belarus and Luxembourg in qualifying  and the full-backs, Djibril Sidibe and Benjamin Mendy, have just returned from injuries.

Bert van Marwijk has not had much time to get to know his players.  Read a tactical analysis here Van Marwijk will aim to tighten the defence and hope that pacy players such as Mathew Leckie and Robbie Kruse can cause damage up front.  This team are not used to playing opponents of the highest calibre and may be overwhelmed against France, Denmark and Peru.

Read a tactical analysis here Ricardo Gareca has made Peru go back to their roots and they now play with a blend of determination, discipline and creativity. Edison Flores is a wonderful attacking midfielder.  Guerrerro has not played since November and, no matter how important he is to the rest of the team, he will lack match practice when he steps on the pitch in Russia.

Read a tactical analysis here Eriksen is one of the best playmakers in Europe and there is pace on the left side with Celta Vigos Pione Sisto.  Hareides first-choice defensive midfielder, William Kvist, has lost his place at his club, FC Copenhagen, and may not start in Russia, potentially leaving a gap for opponents to exploit.

Read a tactical analysis here Lionel Messi deserves a mention but the Barcelona forward is backed up by players such as Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala, Gonzalo Higuain and Angel Di Maria.  A central defence pairing of Federico Fazio and Nicolas Otamendi does not instil confidence and none of the goalkeepers had more than 10 caps going into the tournament.
