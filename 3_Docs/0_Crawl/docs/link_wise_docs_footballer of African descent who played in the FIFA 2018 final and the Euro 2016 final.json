{"doc": " Get the App Why France Are Carrying Africas Hopes in the World Cup Final Tom  Williams Special to Bleacher Report July 13, 2018 Officially, Africas involvement in the World Cup ended in Samara on June 28, when Senegal were eliminated by Colombia. But in the eyes of football fans from across the continent, there is still one African team left in the tournament. And they face Croatia in the final on Sunday. at least  15 players with African roots  in the France squad, and their lineages stem from all over Africa. Samuel Umtiti was born in Cameroon, Steve Mandanda in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Paul Pogbas parents are from Guinea, NGolo Kantes from Mali. Blaise Matuidis parents are from Angola and came to France via DR Congo. Kylian Mbappe has an Algerian mother and a Cameroonian father. Presnel Kimpembe and Steven Nzonzis fathers are Congolese. Corentin Tolissos dad is from Togo. The list goes on. They are associations the players wear proudly. After Frances scintillating 4-3 victory over Argentina in the last 16, Kimpembe posted  a video on Instagram  that showed the teams playersamong them Pogba, Benjamin Mendy and Antoine Griezmanndancing to the song \"Seka Seka\" by Congolese artist DJ Marechal on the plane taking them back to their base camp in Istra. One Twitter user   that it could have been filmed on a bus destined for the Malian capital Bamako. African music has been playing in the background throughout Frances World Cup journey, even extending to the stadiums. The song played each time France score a goal is \"Magic in the Air\" by Ivorian group Magic System, which was chosen as the teams official fan song prior to the tournament by the French Football Federation. The four-piece group  performed for the French  squad (and coach Didier Deschamps) at Clairefontaine ahead of their departure to Brazil for the 2014 World Cup, and \"Magic in the Air\" has been their theme song ever since. Frances African connections have earned them the tag of Africas \"sixth team\" at the 2018  FIFA World Cup , and they have an even broader appeal than the five African sidesEgypt, Morocco, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisiawho featured at the tournament. Umtiti, Mbappe and Pogba have all been key players for France FRANCK FIFE/Getty Images In the eyes of many African football fans, France are not just a team full of players with African heritage. They are something akin to a Pan-African football team. As one of four Cameroon-born players to have made it to the World Cup (along with the Swiss trio of Francois Moubandje, Breel Embolo and Yvon Mvogo), Umtitis performances in Russia have been followed particularly closely in the land of his birth, and there was delight when he scored the goal against Belgium that sent France into the final. \"His goal in the semi-final was greeted with a lot of enthusiasm and passion, especially here in Yaounde,\" says Njie Enow Ebai, a journalist from national broadcaster Cameroon Radio Television. \"One newspaper even had the headline: CAMEROON QUALIFIES FRANCE FOR WORLD CUP FINAL.\" Ebai says that for Cameroonian football fans in the French-speaking parts of the country, supporting France is a natural choice. \"People tend to gravitate towards the French national team. They recognise themselves in that team,\" he says. \"If you go to most of the major bars, pubs and hotels, theyre airing World Cup games and you very often see fans clad in French colours cheering   to victory. Its not like its Cameroon playing, but you can see from the celebrations that theres a lot of support for France.\" Mbappes Cameroonian ancestry has given people in Cameroon an additional reason to root for France. The teenagers popularity has been further enhanced by the fact that he shares his surname and certain physical characteristics with Samuel Mbappe Leppe, whose performances in midfield for Oryx Douala in the 1960s turned him into the first star of Cameroonian football. In Mali, too, football fans have rallied in support of Mbappe and France. Loyalties in Bamoko are typically split between Barcelona and Real Madrid, with those of a Barca bearing tending to support Lionel Messis Argentina while fans of a Madrid persuasion pitch in with Cristiano Ronaldos Portugal (up to now, at least). After both Argentina and Portugal fell by the wayside, France stepped into the void. \"During this tournament, the people of Mali have considered that Africa is represented by six countries and not by five. The sixth team is France,\" says Malian journalist Amadou Alhousseini Toure. \"People are supporting France more than any other team because those who are pro-Barca saw Argentina go out and those who are pro-Real Madrid saw Portugal go out. People support France because of the African players who play for them.\" As a former French colony, Mali still gets news piped into the country from France via media organisations such as Canal+, Radio France International and Agence France-Presse. For those interested in football in the country, it means that Frances club sidesand by extension their playersare even more familiar than teams from the local area. \"Theres a strong French influence in our media, and people are generally sympathetic towards France,\" Toure says in a phone call from Bamako. \"There are historic reasonsthe help of the French army in the reconquest of the northern part of Mali is one recent examplebut its not just that. Its a football that people know. Ligue 1 matches are shown on TV5, and people know the players like the backs of their hands.\" In Senegal, interest in the French national team stretches back over half a century. \"Our parents and our elders followed France in the 1950s via the radio and the newspapers,\" says Mamadou Koume, a journalist based in Dakar. \"Lots of [Senegalese] footballers at the time had nicknames like Kopa [after Raymond Kopa], Fontaine [after Just Fontaine], Marche [after Roger Marche], Ujlaki [after Joseph Ujlaki] or Jonquet [after Robert Jonquet].\" Belgium was DR Congos former colonial ruler, but there again, Frances televisual reach has enabled it to insert itself into the local culture. \"Theres a societal influence here because everyones hooked up to French television stations,\" says Congolese journalist Dickson Yalla. \"One in every three homes in Kinshasa will have a Canal+ decoder, so theres a strong cultural influence from France and we get the French news as well. Theyre the first national team [outside the country] that Congolese people follow.\" Inevitably, interest in the French national team in DR Congo centres around the players with ties to the countryMandanda, Matuidi, Kimpembe, Nzonzibut not all of those with a Congolese connection are viewed in the same light. Mandanda is not blamed for having opted to play for France (a blow softened by the fact that his younger brother, Parfait, now keeps goal for DR Congo). Nzonzi, on the other hand, has not been forgiven for repeatedly turning down the countrys call before finally winning his first France cap last year at the age of 28. \"Steven Nzonzi is viewed very badly. Its excusable for Mandanda, but its not excusable for Nzonzi,\" says Yalla. There are mixed feelings about Steven Nzonzi in DR Congo Nzonzi is not the only player with African ancestry who can testify to the fury of a mother country scorned. Even a player as universally admired as Kante was held in contempt by football fans in Mali for holding out for a call from France, although attitudes toward him have since softened. Nabil Fekir created a maelstrom of controversy in Algeria when, after months of suspense, he elected to play for France in March 2015 rather than the country of his parents birth. While matters of eligibility are generally seen in shades of grey in most of Frances former colonies, in Algeria issues involving the countrys former colonial masters have a habit of being viewed in stark black and white. Having brutally colonised Algeria for 132 years, France has a deeply sensitive relationship with the North African nation, meaning it is one Francophone country where support for   is thin on the ground. \"I think most people are against the French national team,\" says Maher Mezahi, an Algerian journalist based in Algiers. \"Its not the nicest thing to say, but for the older generations, as soon as they see the [French] flag or hear the anthem, it reminds them of bad memories. The younger generation havent really experienced that and theyre maybe fans of Mbappe or Pogba and they identify with them, so they have a stronger attachment to the French team.\" Feelings of enmity towards France have been sharpened by the role Deschamps has played in abridging the international careers of Karim Benzema and Samir Nasrithe two most high-profile French players of Algerian descent of the last 10 yearsand Hatem Ben Arfa, who is of Tunisian extraction. Samir Nasri and Karim Benzema are no longer part of the set-up John Berry/Getty Images Nasri retired from international football in 2014 after Deschamps did not take him to the World Cup, and Ben Arfa last played for France in November 2015. Benzemas France career has been in suspended animation ever since the Mathieu Valbuena   erupted three years ago. After missing out on a place at Euro 2016, Benzema accused Deschamps of bowing to pressure from \"a racist part of France.\" When Eric Cantona insinuated that Deschamps was racist,  the France coach sued him Deschamps predecessor, Laurent Blanc, became embroiled in a race row in 2011. He was secretly recorded apparently voicing support for quotas that would have limited the number of non-white dual-nationality footballers allowed to play for Frances representative youth teams. cleared of wrongdoing  by the FFF, but the case highlighted the extent to which French football had fallen short of the ideals of racial harmony encapsulated by the famous black-blanc-beur slogan attached to Frances celebrated 1998 team. Twenty years on from the 1998 triumph, France and Deschamps are once again preparing for a World Cup final with players whose roots extend right across the former French empire. The countrys unresolved social issues mean that glib associations between sporting success and societal integration are  generally now avoided , but beyond Frances borders, Les Bleus have become a symbol of Pan-African unity. When France take to the pitch to face Croatia in Moscow on Sunday, they will have not just the eyes of a nation upon them, but the eyes of a continent. How Are Clubs Managing Players Mental Health?

On 17 August, Umtiti made his first appearance for Barcelona in the second leg of the  2016 Supercopa de Espana  which Barcelona won 30 versus   and lifted the trophy.  Umtiti picked up a knee injury in September 2016 while in Barcelona training, causing him to miss a crucial   clash against   He scored his first goal for the club, on 4 March 2017, against  Celta de Vigo  with Barcelona winning 50 at the Camp Nou.

Umtiti assisted his teammates in recovering from a 40 first leg deficit to a historic 61 victory, the biggest comeback in the history of the Champions League.  He would cap off his first year in Spain by winning the  201617 Copa del Rey  and by establishing himself firmly as first-choice in central defence for the club alongside Pique.

Umtiti scored the winning goal against   at Camp Nou, on 14 April, in a 21 victory for the Catalans.  A week later, on 21 April, Umtiti started for Barcelona in the  2018 Copa del Rey Final , holding a clean sheet in an eventual 50 victory over Sevilla at   Additionally, Umtiti won his first La Liga winners medal during his second season in Spain, with the defender appearing in 40 games and scoring one goal across all competitions. On 3 June 2018, Umtiti signed a new five-year contract with Barcelona. The release clause was subsequently set at 500 million.  Umtiti was named as a substitute for the  2018 Supercopa de Espana  behind Pique and a new summer signing  . Despite not featuring and with Barcelona winning the match 21 against Sevilla, Umtiti claimed his fifth winners medal since joining the club.

He later earned extremely positive reviews for his performance in the semi-final against the incumbent world champions   This led to a lot of excitement over Umtitis prospects for his newly signed club, Barcelona, and his future as a player.

{"doc": "  content goes here  Illustrations by Josue Evilla Photos from Getty, AP, EPA, USA Today, PA and Icon A panel of 80, featuring writers, television analysts, World Cup veterans and other former professionals, as well as editors from ESPNs European, North American, South America, African, Asian and Australasian desks, voted for the top 50 players competing in Russia. World Cup Rank The top 50 players at Russia 2018,  as rated by our experts 2014 rank: 1 Messi might be the king of club football, but its been a different story for his Argentina career. He was sent off after two minutes of his debut in 2005 and famously quit international football in 2016 after losing three finals in three years. Happily, he changed his mind, and Argentina would surely not have qualified for Russia without him; they are no \"one-man\" team, but do depend greatly on Messi.  At least he should be fresh  for this World Cup after Barcelonas early Champions League exit.   Tim Vickery 2014 Rank: 2 At 33 and some 12 years after he was a semifinalist, the Real Madrid forward and Ballon dOr holder is likely to be facing his last best chance of winning the World Cup, even though he has said he can play until he is 40. Ronaldo helped guide his country to unexpected glory at Euro 2016 and travels to Russia for his fourth World Cup appearance as Portugals all-time leading scorer with 81 goals, 15 of which were scored in qualifying.   Mark Ogden 2014 rank: 6 His World Player of the Year award hopes rest entirely on performances in Russia. With a team that is better tactically and, it is hoped, superior emotionally to the previous World Cup, Neymar should have the platform to display his immense talent. Can coach Tite integrate his stars individual ambition with the needs of the team? And can Neymar control the excesses of temperament that brought him six yellow cards in qualification?   Tim Vickery Kevin De Bruyne 2014 rank: N/A When Belgium beat Estonia 8-1 in November 2016, manager Roberto Martinez fielded the Manchester City midfielder, previously used on one side of the attack, in a deeper, central position. The move has proved just as effective against stronger opponents, with De Bruynes change of gear and passing range galvanising his sides tempo and fluency. Having completed a wonderful club season and won the Premier League, he can help Belgium achieve great things in Russia.   Nick Ames 2014 rank: N/A The Tottenham forward heads into his first World Cup carrying Englands goal-scoring hopes on his shoulders. Kane struggled to impress during Euro 2016, but he has become the first name on Gareth Southgates team sheet and will aim to become Englands first World Cup Golden Boot winner since Gary Lineker topped the charts with six goals at the 1986 tournament in Mexico. If Kane does hit form -- he scored 41 goals in all competitions for Tottenham this season -- England can go far.   Mark Ogden 2014 rank: 4 Suarez and the World Cup have had a rocky history. He was suspended from the 2010 semifinal after a blatant handball vs. Ghana and kicked out of the knockout stages four years later after biting Italys Giorgio Chiellini. As such, Uruguays high hopes in Russia depend greatly on whether one of the best centre-forwards around -- and the  countrys all-time leading scorer , with 50 goals -- can manage to stay on the pitch all the way through the campaign.   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: N/A After scoring the goal in October that returned Egypt to the World Cup after a 28-year absence, Salah politely declined former Zamalek president Mamdouh Abbas offer of a new home and, instead, requested a donation to one of his charitable causes. It is one example of why the player of the year in England,  who has been passed fit for Russia , is so highly regarded at home, to the extent that many see him running the place; in recent Egyptian presidential elections, Salah received write-in votes.   Colin Udoh 2014 rank: N/A It is rare nowadays for a player to become a superstar without having played club football in his own country, but that is the case for Griezmann. Labelled too small when he was trialing for French club academies between the ages of 11 and 14, he had to go across the Pyrenees. Real Sociedad gave him his chance and never regretted it. When he won the Europa League this season in Lyon, only 70 kilometers from his hometown of Macon, there was an element of showing Ligue 1 teams what they had missed.   Julien Laurens 2014 rank: 10 Could this be Hazards World Cup? He flickered in 2014 and sparkled intermittently at Euro 2016, but Belgium fell short, and it would feel like a waste if that trend repeated itself in Russia. He has taken the bit between his teeth under manager Roberto Martinez, enjoying himself from a left-sided position behind Romelu Lukaku, and feels he and his teammates have learned from past disappointment. \"Now we have experience,\" Hazard said. \"We know what to do to be ready. We have one target, which is to reach the final.\"   Nick Ames 2014 rank: N/A Already the top scorer in national team history with 52 goals -- 16 of which came during qualifying for Russia -- Lewandowski is viewed as Polands greatest player by many, even if those who remember Kazimierz Deyna, Grzegorz Lato and Zbigniew Boniek gracing the pitch in the 1970s and 1980s have other ideas. Lewandowski scored just once in each of his two European Championship appearances; he can boost his status by impressing at his first World Cup.   Michael Yokhin 2014 rank: 34 Kroos might represent the worst couple of million euros Bayern Munich never spent. The German giants refused to raise his pay grade to that of Mario Gotze, then sold him to Real Madrid in 2014. Since then, Kroos has won multiple Champions Leagues while Bayerns quest for a sixth European Cup triumph remains unfulfilled. Hell be the first name on Joachim Lows team sheet in Russia and the single most important player if Germany are to retain their crown.   Raphael Honigstein David De Gea 2014 rank: N/A  were stingy winners in 2010 -- two goals conceded in seven games, five clean sheets -- but, as vital as Iker Casillas was in goal, Spain controlled games ruthlessly through possession. That era has passed, meaning De Gea will have more to do. His World Cup debut in 2014? A pain in the butt, literally; a strained muscle meant Pepe Reina replaced the rested Casillas in the third group match. Now De Gea is arguably the worlds best. Time to show it.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: 32 The brightest star of his generation, three-time Champions League winner and midfield maestro Modric has an image problem in his homeland, where  hes been charged with perjury  after allegedly lying at the trial of former Dinamo Zagreb director Zdravko Mamic. Some Croatian fans expected Modric to speak out against the countrys unpopular football association, but he did not and needs a stunning tournament to regain the backing of those who voiced disdain toward the federation by disrupting a Euro 2016 game against Czech Republic.   Michael Yokhin 2014 rank: 11 Only Lionel Messi and Gabriel Batistuta have scored more goals for Argentina, but Aguero has consistently come up short in tournaments, a frequent casualty of season-ending burnout. So the knee surgery he underwent in April poses a key question: Will he -- again -- be less than 100 percent at the World Cup? Or might he be better rested and finally able to translate his friendship with Messi into a devastating partnership?   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: N/A Records are there to be beaten, and it is proof of Mbappes incredible talent that he has set so many new marks since bursting onto the scene some 18 months ago. He succeeded Thierry Henry as Monacos youngest-ever player (16 years, 347 days) and goal scorer (17 years, 62 days). In March, at 19 and three months, he became the youngest player to score twice for France. No teenager has more Champions League goals than the 10 Mbappe has managed, either.  The kid is good.  Julien Laurens 2014 rank: N/A After a timid start to his international career -- Coutinho made little impression when it mattered in the Copa America tournaments of 2015 and 2016 -- the recent Barcelona signing benefited greatly from the arrival of Tite as national-team coach. Filled with confidence, Coutinho has become an important deadlock-breaker who is able to float across from either wing or support the striker from a central position.   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: 26 Hes a World Cup champion but, individually, Silva has not starred in his two tournament appearances. In 2010, he started just once and got four more minutes as a substitute for Spains winners. Four years later, he missed a chance to make it 2-0 vs. Netherlands, who went on to score five without reply and start the holders on the road to a group-stage exit. Nonetheless, Silva is utterly vital to  s progress as he seeks a definitive performance.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: N/A As events following  Real Madrids Champions League final victory against Liverpool show, barely a week goes past without Ramos doing or saying something that separates him from others; his \"winner\" mentality can take him to the boundaries of competitiveness, though he has never been sent off for Spain. He prepares psychologically for the big stage, hence his four goals in Champions League semifinals and finals. Ramos also \"Panenkad\" his way past Portugal in a Euro 2012 shootout; he will try for another big moment in Russia.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: N/A \"Look at the players who play centrally for Real Madrid and Barcelona; none of them are better than Christian.\" That is how highly Denmark coach Age Hareide rates Eriksen, whose hat trick vs. Republic of Ireland propelled Denmark to Russia 2018. His longer-term influence on a side that is otherwise short of guile cannot be overestimated and, Eriksen having never played at a World Cup before, can turn an average team into one capable of threatening anybody.   Nick Ames 2014 rank: 30 On La Renardiere council estate in the city of Roissy to the north of Paris, where Pogba grew up, four artists painted a huge fresco of him just after Euro 2016. He is a hero where he comes from; the last player to have a similar impact in France was Zinedine Zidane in Marseille. The country hopes Pogba can achieve something similar this summer -- minus any head-butts -- after a  testing club season at Manchester United  Julien Laurens 2014 rank: N/A What should have been a dream day ended in tears and disappointment for Dybala: In 2015, making his first Argentina start, he was sent off. First to comfort him was Lionel Messi, who was red-carded himself on his international debut vs. Hungary. \"The Jewel\" has admitted that it is \"difficult\" for him to play with Messi because their styles are similar, but Argentina manager Jorge Sampaoli saw enough in the Juventus forward to include him in his squad for Russia.   Nicolas Baier 2014 rank: 3 There were things beyond his winning goal in 2010 that sum up Iniesta -- who is set for his international farewell  after leaving Barcelona  -- and the feeling in the Spain squad, then and now.   went to South Africa with an inspirational DVD provided by physio and friend Emili Ricart and then, upon scoring vs. Netherlands, paid tribute to close friend Dani Jarque, the Espanyol captain who had died suddenly 11 months earlier. The gesture was planned by several Spain players and, back home, Jarques wife was moved beyond words.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: 18 Whatever the strains of his relationship with Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain, with the national team Cavani seems to have no problem being the second member of a potent strike force behind Luis Suarez. Approaching his third World Cup, Cavani works so hard that he could accurately be described as a \"box-to-box centre-forward,\" though he does his best work in front of goal: Cavani was the top scorer, with 10, in South American qualification.   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: N/A His is a fairy-tale story that could inspire Hollywood. Eight years ago, Kante was playing in the French eighth division at Suresnes in the west suburbs of Paris. At 19, it looked as though he had no future in professional football -- at the same age, Kylian Mbappe had won two Ligue 1 titles -- yet Kante kept working and eventually made it. He went through lower leagues and tiny, obscure stadiums before finding success and fame with Leicester, Chelsea and France.   Julien Laurens 2014 rank: 27 Growing up in Gelsenkirchen, Neuer didnt want to go in goal; the kids in his neighbourhood played on concrete, which is not the ideal surface to be diving on. His first coach at Schalke 04 put him between the sticks when he was 5, and hes since fulfilled the job with a certain reluctance. Neuer is happiest when he can clear up with his head or feet, sweeper-keeper style. Due to a complicated fracture in his foot, he has missed almost all of the club season.   Raphael Honigstein 2014 rank: N/A The left-back, who is set to appear in his second World Cup, will broadcast his daily routine during the tournament on his official YouTube channel, which has more than 670,000 subscribers and features videos from his life in Madrid, as well moments of relaxation around his family, his sons and his wife, Brazilian actress Clarice Alves. Marcelo has also launched an official app. But its on the pitch in Russia where the worlds best left-back will leave a lasting impression.   Vladimir Bianchini 2014 rank: N/A Under the tutelage of now-national team coach Julen Lopetegui, Isco was part of the Spain under-21 squad that became European champions in 2013. The then-21-year-old, who scored three times in Israel and was included in the team of the tournament, counted among his teammates David De Gea, Thiago Alcantara, Koke, Nacho and Rodrigo. Spain wont emulate their 2010 World Cup win unless some -- or all -- of those find top form in Russia.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: 28 The 2010 World Cups Golden Boot winner once scored 120 goals in a season. Muller was 8 at the time and playing for TSV Pahl, south of Munich. He has been less prolific in his most recent seasons, during which he has primarily operated on the right wing or as a box-to-box player providing service to a more orthodox centre-forward. His leadership qualities and ingenuity ensure he will remain in Germanys starting XI, but his role has somewhat diminished.   Raphael Honigstein 2014 rank: 47 On the wall of Piques office at his video games company is a large, imposing picture of the handsome, rich, successful, bright, world-famous centre-half ... crying like a baby while hugging his mother. The scene is the main tribune at Soccer City in Johannesburg, the moment just seconds after Spain won the 2010 World Cup. For much of the next 90 minutes, following the release of tension brought by such a surge of overwhelming emotion, Pique scoured the stadium for its goal nets to mark the most momentous of occasions.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: 40 After a win vs. Honduras in 2010, I asked Busquets for a comment. \"Why always me? Is it because Im friendly and polite that I have to be asked all the time?\" he replied fiercely. He was upset about being blamed for a defeat to Switzerland, and it took then-manager Vicente Del Bosque admitting \"if I had to be reincarnated as a current footballer, it would be Sergio Busquets\" to restore calm. Busquets, who turns 30 the day after this World Cup ends, will be key in Spains midfield.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: N/A There was anguish across Senegal when Mane suffered a hamstring injury vs. Cape Verde that threatened to keep him out of decisive World Cup qualifiers against South Africa the following month. However, he not only recovered but also delivered a virtuoso performance in the first match by setting up the two goals that helped Senegal clinch a place in Russia. If they are to make a similar impact to their quarterfinal run of the 2002 World Cup, Mane will surely be a key player.   Colin Udoh 2014 rank: N/A While undoubtedly a magnificent player, Rakitic has missed becoming a superstar. He never surpassed Xavi Hernandez at Barcelona; with the national team, Luka Modric has always been a couple of steps ahead. In fact, Croatian pundits still discuss finding balance between the duo -- think of them as the Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard of Croatia -- even though both are into their 30s and have played together for more than a decade. Rakitic has never disappointed, but rarely stands out.   Michael Yokhin 2014 rank: N/A Lukaku has not always felt comfortable at international level -- \"I didnt enjoy being a part of it; I didnt like being selected,\" he said of life under previous coach Marc Wilmots -- but he has stepped up under Roberto Martinez, his old manager at Everton, and looks secure as the spearhead of a team that must deliver on long-held promise. Nobody has scored more for Belgium; Lukaku can cut an ungainly figure up front when things are not going well, but is one of the worlds best strikers when firing.   Nick Ames 2014 rank: N/A He was a breakout star at the previous World Cup, but the subsequent four years have been dogged by frustration at club level: He was signed by Real Madrid before being loaned to Bayern Munich. By contrast, James loves playing for the national team because his importance is unchallenged -- he is given freedom to roam in search of the space from which he can do most damage. He will look at Russia as a moment to re-emphasise his status among the global elite.   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: 41 The virtual world has turned him into an object of ridicule after his misses in finals for Argentina, but that is a gross lack of respect for Higuains superb career.   scored at will with River Plate, Real Madrid, Napoli and Juventus and has long been a key member of the   squad. However, to quiet his critics he still needs to pass an important test, and the World Cup will give him a chance to do just that.   Nicolas Baier 2014 rank: N/A Four years ago, Gabriel Jesus was a 17-year-old fan of the Brazil national team, cheering on his country during the World Cup it hosted. Indeed, he joined the festivities by painting the walls and streets around his neighborhood -- Jardim Peri, north of Sao Paulo -- with Canarinho colors. Four years on and having made his mark in the club game with Manchester City, he is the starting striker in Tites lineup, finally realising his dream of playing in a World Cup.   Vladimir Bianchini 2014 rank: N/A To get an idea how important Son is to South Korea, consider what coach Shin Tae-yong said in April when asked his plan to get the best from the attacker: \"Were trying to implement the 4-4-2 formation that Tottenham uses.\" If South Korea have any hope to getting out of a group with Germany, Mexico and Sweden, Son has to be decisive. He left the 2014 World Cup in tears but can be more influential this time.   John Duerden 2014 rank: 29 Having started at age 6 at DJK Westfalen Gelsenkirchen, Ozil played for two more clubs in the next five years, searching for a big break. In 2000, his father, Mustafa, asked (fourth-division) Rot-Weiss Essen youth director Walter Kik to look at the boy juggling the ball outside. Kik needed five minutes to decide and, weeks later, sanctioned a monthly payment for the 12-year-old. Schalke 04 then became aware of Ozil, whose career took off when he signed for the Royal Blues in 2005.   Raphael Honigstein 2014 rank: N/A He will arrive in Russia in good shape for his second World Cup, literally. The former Corinthians, Shakhtar Donetsk and Anzhi Makhachkala midfielder has changed his diet in recent years, cutting foods that were affecting his physique. What happened? More goals, more assists and better all-around play. Willian captained Brazil for the first time in a November friendly vs. Japan, becoming the 14th player to wear the armband under Tite.   Vladimir Bianchini 2014 rank: N/A Ulla Holthoff was the first woman to commentate on football in Germany and created the countrys first football-focused talk show. She also happens to be the mother of Hummels, who is the most cultured, opinionated and (arguably) handsome centre-back to ever represent the national team. No wonder   called Holthoff \"the mother of modern football\": Germany would be less progressive without her, on and off the pitch.   Raphael Honigstein 2014 rank: N/A The Tottenham midfielder is the player with X factor in Gareth Southgates England squad. Alli scores goals but also creates them. It is his fiery temperament that is a concern, with indiscipline and reckless challenges always threatening to prove costly and Alli sometimes appearing like a petulant red card waiting to happen. His partnership with Harry Kane is crucial for Tottenham, but we are still waiting to see the pair click together successfully on the international stage.   Mark Ogden 2014 rank: N/A One of only five survivors from Englands ill-fated 2014 World Cup campaign, the Manchester City forward has matured as a player and, in the buildup to Russia, has brushed off  criticism over a gun tattoo . Working under Pep Guardiola has enabled Sterling to iron out his flaws and develop into a more dangerous, all-round forward; his national-team manager, Gareth Southgate, will expect the winger to carry on his club form.   Mark Ogden 2014 rank: 36 Courtois was no fan of former coach Marc Wilmots. The goalkeeper pointedly said Belgium had been \"tactically outclassed\" by Italy in a 2-0 defeat at Euro 2016 and, with his father, recently began legal action against the ex-manager for \"libel and defamation\" after Wilmots allegedly suggested the elder Courtois had leaked team information. Things are more settled under Roberto Martinez, and Courtois, who conceded only six goals during qualifying, remains a world-class last line of defence for his country.   Nick Ames 2014 rank: N/A Napolis self-styled \"street dog\" made one of Belgiums more memorable contributions at Brazil 2014, scoring a late winner against Algeria in the group stage. It won him a bet with his father, whose moustache he then shaved off. Similar scoring heroics would go down well in Russia, but Mertens has only found the net against relatively weak nations in recent times, despite revelatory form for his club. He should start on the right side of attack.   Nick Ames 2014 rank: N/A Uruguays centre-back, captain and leader has been present throughout the 12-year reign of coach Oscar Washington Tabarez. As intelligent as he is ferocious, Godin organises the defensive line and is a forceful, thoughtful voice on off-the-field questions. Moreover, he has a habit of weighing in with vital goals, such as the group-stage winner vs. Italy in 2014. He confessed recently that \"there isnt a day goes by that I stop thinking about the World Cup. I dream of lifting the trophy.\"   Tim Vickery Angel Di Maria 2014 rank: 23 It seems like a curse keeps hunting Di Maria whenever he is on national-team duty. Because of injuries, he could not play the semifinals and final of the 2014 World Cup, while he also had to be substituted due to physical discomfort in a pair of Copa America finals against Chile.   admitted that international setbacks have  taken a physical and psychological toll  but, in Russia, he has an opportunity to put those behind him.   Nicolas Baier 2014 rank: N/A Spain manager Julen Lopetegui might decide that talent is paramount and that Asensio must start, but what looks likely is that he begins the World Cup as the first replacement off the bench, for Andres Iniesta. Fortunately for his country, just one of the remarkable things about this talented attacking midfielder is that Asensio remains as intensely focused and likely to affect whether he starts or comes on. Russia offers a stage upon which he could propel himself from super player to all-out superstar.   Graham Hunter 2014 rank: 19 A dynamic, predatory centre-forward, Falcao was so desperate to recover from injury in time for the previous World Cup that it might have had a detrimental effect on his performances in the following two years. This, then, is a big moment, perhaps the most important of his career. The headache for coach Jose Pekerman is that Falcaos lack of back-to-goal skills makes it hard for him to play up front on his own.   Tim Vickery 2014 rank: N/A In March 2016, Dembele was asked which foot he favoured. The then-Rennes player replied that he preferred his left, to which the puzzled journalist replied, \"But you score a lot of goals with your right foot.\" \"Thats true. But Im still more left-footed,\" Dembele said. \"Why do you take penalties with your right foot, though?\" the interviewer continued. The young stars response was priceless: \"Ha, thats because I shoot better with my right foot!\"   Julien Laurens 2014 rank: N/A While many would-be players choose between education and football at a relatively young age, Varane is one of the exceptions. School was always important to him and his parents, and in June 2011, at the age of 18, he passed his   (specialising in economics). As if studying for exams was not hard enough, he did so while also fielding calls from Zinedine Zidane and Jose Mourinho, who wanted him to sign for Real Madrid. Which he eventually did that same summer.

They have won two  FIFA World Cups , two  UEFA European Championships , two  FIFA Confederations Cups  and one  . France experienced much of its success in four major eras: in the 1950s, 1980s, late 1990s/early 2000s, and mid/late 2010s, respectively, which resulted in numerous major honours. France was one of the four European teams that participated in the  inaugural World Cup in 1930  and, although having been eliminated in the qualification stage six times, is one of only three teams that have entered every World Cup qualifying cycle. In 1958, the team, led by   and  , finished in third place at the  FIFA World Cup . In 1984, France, led by   winner  , won  UEFA Euro 1984  and Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

This was the second time they had won the tournament after winning it on home soil in 1998. France was the first national team to win the three most important mens titles recognized by  : the World Cup, the Confederations Cup, and the Olympic tournament after victory in the Confederations Cup in 2001. The Confederations Cup started in 1992. Prior to this, Uruguay and Italy had won both the Olympic tournament and the World Cup in the 1920s and 1930s. England and Germany had also won both tournaments; albeit England competes as Great Britain in the Olympics and East Germany won the Olympic tournament in 1976. Since 2001,   (after the  ) and   (after the  ) are the other two national teams that have won these three titles.

The following year, on 12 February 1905, France contested their first-ever home match against  . The match was played at the  Parc des Princes  in front of 500 supporters. France won the match 10 with the only goal coming from  . Due to disagreements between   and the  Union des Societes Francaises de Sports Athletiques  (USFSA), the countrys  , France struggled to establish an identity. On 9 May 1908, the French Interfederal Committee (CFI), a rival organization to the USFSA, ruled that FIFA would now be responsible for the clubs appearances in forthcoming Olympic Games and not the USFSA. In 1919, the CFI transformed themselves into the  French Football Federation  (FFF). In 1921, the USFSA finally merged with the FFF. In July 1930, France appeared in the inaugural  FIFA World Cup , held in Uruguay. In their first-ever World Cup match, France defeated   41 at the   in   became notable in the match as he scored not only Frances first World Cup goal, but the first goal in World Cup history. Conversely, France also became the first team to not score in a match after losing 10 to fellow group stage opponents  . Another loss to   resulted in the team bowing out in the group stage. The following year saw the first selection of a   player to the national team.  , who was of Senegalese descent, earned his first cap on 15 February in a 21 defeat to  . Diagne later played with the team at the  1938 World Cup , alongside  , who was one of the first players of North African origin to play for the national team.

In the third place match, France defeated West Germany 63 with Fontaine recording four goals, which brought his goal tally in the competition to 13, a World Cup record. The record still stands today. France hosted the inaugural  UEFA European Football Championship  in 1960 and, for the second straight international tournament, reached the semi-finals. In the round, France faced   and were shocked 54 despite being up 42 heading into the 75th minute. In the third-place match, France were defeated 20 by the Czechoslovakians. The 1960s and 70s saw France decline significantly playing under several managers and failing to qualify for numerous international tournaments. On 25 April 1964,   was officially installed as the teams first manager. Under Guerin, France failed to qualify for the  1962 World Cup  and the  1964 European Nations Cup . The team did return to major international play following qualification for the  1966 World Cup . The team lost in the group stage portion of the tournament. Guerin was fired following the World Cup. He was replaced by   and  , who worked as   in dual roles. The two only lasted four matches and were replaced by former international  , who only lasted two.   succeeded Fontaine and, following his early struggles in   for the  1970 World Cup , was fired and replaced by  , who could not get the team to the competition. Boulogne was later fired following his failure to qualify for the  1974 World Cup  and was replaced by the Romanian  , who became the only international manager to ever manage the national team. Kovacs also turned out to be a disappointment failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup and  UEFA Euro 1976 . After two years in charge, he was sacked and replaced with   captained France to victory at  UEFA Euro 1984 Under Hidalgo, France flourished, mainly due to the accolades of great players like defenders   and  , striker   and midfielder  , who, alongside   and   formed the   (\"Magic Square\"), which would haunt opposing defenses beginning at the  1982 World Cup , where France reached the semi-finals losing on penalties to rivals  . The semi-final match-up is considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history and was  marred with controversy  France earned their first major international honor two years later, winning  , which they hosted. Under the leadership of Platini, who scored a tournament-high nine goals, France defeated   20 in the final. Platini and   scored the goals. Following the Euro triumph, Hidalgo departed the team and was replaced by former international  . France later completed the hat-trick when they won gold at the  1984 Summer Olympics  and, a year later, defeated Uruguay 20 to win the  Artemio Franchi Trophy , an early precursor to the  FIFA Confederations Cup  and   scored the goals. In a span of a year, France were holders of three of the four major international trophies. At the  1986 World Cup , France were favorites to win the competition, and, for the second consecutive World Cup, reached the semi-finals where they faced West Germany. Again, however, they lost. A 42 victory over Belgium gave France third place. In 1988, the FFF opened the   National Football Institute. Its opening ceremony was attended by then- President of France . Five months after Clairefontaines opening, manager   was fired and was replaced by Michel Platini, who failed to get the team to the  1990 World Cup . Platini did lead the team to   and, despite going on a 19-match unbeaten streak prior to the competition, suffered elimination in the group stage. A week after the completion of the tournament, Platini stepped down as manager and was replaced by his assistant  . Under Houllier, France and its supporters experienced a heartbreaking meltdown after having qualification to the  1994 World Cup  all but secured with two matches to go, which were against last place   and  .

The victory gave the team the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, and it was also the first time that a reigning World Cup winner went on to capture the Euro. Following the result, the France national team was inserted to the number one spot in the  FIFA World Rankings  captaining France at the  2006 FIFA World Cup France failed to maintain that pace in subsequent tournaments. Although, the team won the  2001 FIFA Confederations Cup , France suffered a first round elimination at the  2002 World Cup . One of the greatest shocks in World Cup history saw France condemned to a 10 defeat to debutantes   in the opening game of the tournament. France became the second nation to be eliminated in the first round while holding the World Cup crown, the first one being Brazil in 1966. After the  , and  2018 World Cups , Italy, Spain, and Germany were also added to this list.  After France finished bottom of the group, Lemerre was dismissed and was replaced by  . A full strength team started out strongly at  , but they were upset in the quarter-finals by the eventual winners  . Santini resigned as coach and   was picked as his replacement. France struggled in the early qualifiers for the  2006 World Cup . This prompted Domenech to persuade several past members out of international retirement to help the national team qualify, which they accomplished following a convincing 40 win over   on the final day of qualifying. In the 2006 World Cup final stages, France finished undefeated in the group stage portion and advanced all the way to the final defeating the likes of  , Brazil and   en route. France played Italy in the   and, in part down to  controversial disruptions in extra time  that lead to captain Zinedine Zidane being sent off, failed to find a winning goal, Italy winning 53 on penalties to be crowned World Cup champions.

France bowed out during the group stage portion of the tournament after having been placed in the  group of death  (which included   and Italy).  Just like the teams previous World Cup qualifying campaign, the 2010 campaign got off to a disappointing start with France suffering disastrous losses and earning uninspired victories. France eventually finished second in the group and earned a spot in the UEFA play-offs against the  Republic of Ireland  for a place in  .

The team is also referred to as   or   (The Tri-color Team) due to the teams utilization of the countrys national colors: blue, white, and red. During the 1980s, France earned the nickname the  \"Brazilians of Europe\"  mainly due to the accolades of the   (\"Magic Square\"), who were anchored by  . Led by coach  , France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their  South American counterparts Representation of multi-ethnic France The France national team has long reflected the   of the country. Already in its first decades, there were in the France national team players that were considered of non-\"genuinely\" French origin, being descendants of immigrants of former colonies of the  French Colonial Empire  or of European countries neighboring France. The first black player to play in the national team was   in 1931. Diagne was the son of the first African elected to the  French National Assembly . Seven years later, Diagne played on the  1938 FIFA World Cup  team that featured  , the second footballer of North African descent to play for the national team (after  Abdelkader Ben Bouali  who was selected to play against   in 1937). At the 1958 World Cup, in which France reached the semi-finals, many sons of immigrants (such as   and Bernard Chiarelli) were integral to the teams success. The tradition has since continued, with successful French players such as  Hatem Ben Arfa , and   all having either one or both of their parents foreign-born. During the 1990s, the team was widely celebrated as an example of the modern   French ideal.  The 1998 World Cup-winning team was celebrated and praised for inspiring pride and optimism about the prospects for the \"French model\" of   Of the 23 players on the team, the squad featured players who could trace their origins to Armenia, Algeria,  , Argentina, Ghana, Senegal, Italy,  , Portugal and  , with the   of the team being Zinedine Zidane, who was born in   to Algerian immigrants. France v Belarus at the Stade de France in October 2017. The multiracial makeup of the team has, at times, provoked controversy. In recent years, critics on the  far right of the French political spectrum  have taken issue with the proportional under-representation of ethnic white Frenchmen within the team.   politician  Jean-Marie Le Pen  protested in 1998 that the  Black, Blanc,   team that won the World Cup did not look sufficiently French. In 2002, led by Ghanaian-born  , the French team unanimously and publicly appealed to the French voting public to reject the presidential candidacy of Le Pen and, instead, return President   to office. In 2006, Le Pen resumed his criticism charging that coach Raymond Domenech had selected too many black players.  In 2005, French-Jewish conservative writer   caused controversy by punning to the Israeli newspaper   that despite its earlier slogan, \"the French national team is in fact black-black-black,\" and also adding that, \"France is made fun of all around Europe because of that.\" He later apologized for the comments declaring that they were not meant to be offensive. France lining up before a friendly against   in 2018 The socio-ethnic divide between the public and the team reached a climax during the 2010 World Cup. Once in South Africa, the team did not manage to score a goal in their first two matches, leaving almost no chance of going through save an exceptional win over hosts South Africa. Thereafter, the players went on strike because of what they saw as mismanagement of the Nicolas Anelka case. Anelka had been forced to depart after a slur that leaked to the press. Players said he was misquoted, and complained of the alleged leaker from the staff, the media, and the federation. Instead of training, coach Raymond Domenech read the players petition live on television to the stunned journalists. The national teams overall impact on Frances efforts to integrate its minorities and come to terms with its colonial past has been mixed. In 2001, France played a friendly match at the Stade de France, the site of its 1998 World Cup triumph, against  . It was the countrys first meeting with its former colony, with whom it had fought a  war from 1954 to 1962 , and it proved controversial. Frances national anthem,  , was booed by Algerian supporters before the game, and following a French goal that made the score 41 in the second half, spectators ran onto the field of play, which caused play to be suspended. It was never resumed. In April 2011, the French investigative website Mediapart released a story which claimed that the FFF had been attempting to secretly put in place a quota system in order to limit the number of dual-citizenship players in its national academies. Quoting a senior figure in the FFF, the organization was said to have wanted to set a cap of 30% on the number of players of dual-nationality by limiting places in the academies in the 1213 age bracket.  The FFF responded by releasing a public statement on its website denying the report, stating, \"[N]one of its elected bodies has been validated, or even contemplated a policy of quotas for the recruitment of its training centers.\"  The FFF also announced that it had authorized a full investigation into the matter and, as a result, suspended National Technical Director Francois Blaquart pending the outcome of the investigation.  Former national team player   said of the allegations, \"Initially I thought this was a joke. Im so stunned I dont know what to say,\" while   declared that comments allegedly made by manager Laurent Blanc at the meeting were \"serious and scandalous\". The   also weighed in on the issue, as then President   was quoted as being \"viscerally opposed to any form of quota\", while adding \"setting quotas would be the end of the Republic\". Following the investigation, Blanc was cleared of any wrongdoing.

More and more European-born players of African descent are returning home, but Africas muscle drain is far from over. Abdullahi Boru Halakhe 27 Jun 2018 08:23 GMT Arsenals French born striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang celebrates scoring a goal for Gabon against Guinea-Bissau at the African Cup of Nations [Reuters] In 1998, when France won the  , the slogan \"black, blanc et beur\" was popularly used to describe its team. It reflected the diverse ethnic background of its players - black, white, and beur, or European-born to North African parents. Among Frances top players were Senegalese-born Patrick Vieira, Ghanian-born Marcel Desailly, and French-born (to Algerian parents) Zinedine Zidane, whose \"Frenchness\" came into question after he headbutted Marco Materazzi at the 2006 World Cup final. Europes national and club teams have long benefitted from the talent of players of African background - whether African-born or born to immigrant parents in Europe. Africa has bled football talent to Europe for decades now, which has been detrimental to the development of its professional football.  But, for a while now, a curious new trend has developed. More and more players of African descent have started coming back to the continent to play for their national teams. In this years World Cup, for example, 17 of Moroccos 23 players are European born, mostly in the Netherlands, which has a large Moroccan immigrant community. Medhi Benatia, the teams captain, is French-born. In 2009, Arsenals French-born striker, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, announced his decision to play for Gabon, despite being offered a spot in Italys and Frances national youth teams. In 2012, Aubameyang, whose father is Gabonese, reached the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations with his team. Just before the 2010 World Cup, German-born Kevin-Prince Boateng decided to play for Ghana, where his father is from. Before that, he was a key member of the German national youth team which lifted the European U21 Championship cup in 2009 - a team that included the likes of Mesut Ozil, Mats Hummels, Sami Khedira, and Manuel Neuer. His younger half-brother, Jerome Boateng, is a permanent fixture in Germanys national team and plays for Bayern Munich at club level. In 2016, Crystal Palace star Wilfried Zaha, who was born in the Ivory Coast but has been living in England since he was four, announced his decision to join the Ivorian national team. He previously played for England at both the under-19 and under-21 levels. According to the world football governing body, FIFA, what Aubameyang, Boateng and Zaha did was perfectly legal. In January 2004, it allowed players to represent one country at the youth level and another at senior level, provided that the player applied before his 21st birthday. Does all this mean that African talent is \"coming back home\" to Africa? Unfortunately, not.   Most of these players switch to African national teams because they are unable to make the cut in Europe. This has a lot to do with intense domestic competition but also  with increasing racism Whether this trend of some European-born players of African descent signing up for African national teams continues or not, African football will continue to struggle to retain talent. Today, poor governance, predatory and unregulated football agents and inadequate commercial incentives are continuing to push exceptional African players to leave the continent for Europe. Few African football federations are managed professionally; corruption is rife with money meant for football development ending up in individual officials bank accounts. Earlier this month, a film by Ghanaian investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas revealed that  Kwesi Nyantakyi -  Ghana Football Association ( ) president and  member of the FIFA Council -  a $65,000 bribe from an undercover reporter pretending to be a businessman seeking to sponsor Ghanas football league. Corruption in football is not exclusive to Ghana. It is also a major problem in Nigeria. Former FIFA Executive Committee member  Amos Adamu, who had once served as director-general of the Nigerian National Sports Commission, re ceived a three-year ban and 10,000 Swiss franc (about $10,100) fine from FIFAs ethics committee in 2010 after being found guilty of breaching bribery rules. He received a further three-year ban in 2017. Nigeria and Ghana are Africas football heavyweights - Nigeria will be participating in the World Cup for the sixth time this year. Ghana has won the Africa Cup of Nations four times in the past. Corruption scandals in these two countries should be seen as signs of a larger malaise undoubtedly affecting other, much smaller football federations across Africa. African governments cannot do much to take this corruption epidemic under control, as FIFAs rules against government interference in sports all but tie their hands.  FIFA had suspended  Kenya, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Chads memberships several times in the past because of alleged government  interference in the affairs of independent football federations. Corruption and poor management have stunted local leagues across Africa and discouraged fans from attending games. Predatory and exploitative \"football agents\", who lure young boys with a promise to make them the next big thing in Africas football, have filled the gap left by the lack of adequate training schemes and academies. A lack of regulation and inspection allows these con men to operate with impunity. They promise to sign young boys for famous clubs in Europe and take exorbitant fees from the boys families to secure these \"deals\". Sometimes families sell everything they have to pay the agents because they believe their child will become the next Didier Drogba. In some cases, the agents disappear with the familys savings before the boy even travels to Europe, in others the boy is taken to Europe and left there alone to fend for himself. According to Charity Foot Solidaire, at least 15,000 young football players are   out of West Africa each year under false  pretences, but a lack of monitoring means the number of boys being trafficked abroad could be far higher. As a result, international superstars like Senegals Sadio Mane and Egypts Mohammad Salah prefer to play for European football clubs, rather than staying in Africa Across Africa, young boys will be watching Mane, Salah and other African superstars on TV and dreaming of being like them one day. For many, that dream will never be realised unless African football associations address corruption, poor governance and inadequate commercial sponsorship of the domestic leagues.

The agreement, which was in place until the end of the  , allowed Le Havre to sign Pogba to an   (youth) contract once the player met specific age and scholarship requirements.  On 1 August, Le Havre released an official statement on its website criticising Manchester United and the Pogba family.  Le Havre also announced its intent to ask   to probe the situation. In response to Le Havres accusations, Manchester United threatened to sue the club, while Pogba denied he was leaving Le Havre for monetary reasons, which Le Havre President Jean-Pierre Louvel had alleged to be 87,000 and a house.  Le Havre was also accused by Pogbas former club Torcy of using the same tactics it purported Manchester United to have used when the club acquired Pogba from its youth academy. On the same day of Pogbas announcement to depart for England, Torcy released a press release on its official website criticising Le Havres accusations, stating, \"We will not use the term steal, but the recruiters of Le Havre acted the same way with the club in Torcy.\" The club cited Le Havres acceptance of allowing Pogba to sign an amateur licence with the club without notifying Torcy as its primary reason why.  On 7 October, Manchester United were cleared of wrongdoing by a judge appointed by FIFA, with the declaration that Pogba was not contractually linked to Le Havre.  Despite having the option to appeal, on 18 June 2010, Le Havre officials confirmed that the club had reached an agreement with Manchester United for the transfer of Pogba.

Read a tactical analysis here Russia have a clear gameplan and have benefited from a switch to a back three, which most players use at club level. There are also a number of good box-to-box players in the squad. Russia will sorely miss the injured striker Aleksandr Kokorin while the wing-backs are arguably too old and the centre-backs too young and inexperienced.

Read a tactical analysis here The three attacking midfielders in Pizzis 4-2-3-1  Salem al-Dawsari, Yahya al-Shehri and Fahad al-Muwallad  are talented players who will expect to test any defence in Russia.  The defence is experienced but susceptible to pace and rarely plays against the kind of top-calibre attackers you find at the World Cup.

The team need him if they are to get out of the group.  Read a tactical analysis here Hector Cuper, as always, builds his team on a solid defence and Egypt conceded only 20 goals in his first 35 games in charge.  With Mohamed Salah in a race to get fit in time for the finals, Egypt may struggle to score with Marwan Mohsen often left isolated up front.

Read a tactical analysis here The obvious strength of this team lies up front with Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani forming one of the tournaments most potent partnerships. No obvious weaknesses but the left-sided midfielder Cristian Rodriguez, at 32, is not getting any quicker and that sometimes leaves the full-back Martin Caceres exposed.

Read a tactical analysis here Ronaldo is still the focal point but players such as Bernardo Silva, Andre Silva and Gelson Martins have gained more experience and are able to support him better up front. The central defence is a worry with only Pepe - who is not getting any younger - guaranteed a starting place, with Bruno Alves and Jose Fonte out of form.

Read a tactical analysis here Spain have one of the strongest squads at the World Cup, with the midfield, led by Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, David Silva, Asensio and Isco, particularly impressive. There is not a natural finisher in the squad, such as a David Villa, and Diego Costa has struggled to connect with the midfield when he has played.  Profiles written by Juan I.

Read a tactical analysis here They play with real belief under Renard and Ajaxs Hakim Ziyech is one of the most talented playmakers in Europe. The first-choice goalkeeper, Munir Mohand Mohamedi, started only one league game for Numancia in Spains second tier and is bound to be rusty.

Read a tactical analysis here The attack is simply frightening with players such as Anthony Martial and Alexandre Lacazette not even making the squad.

The planets best teams and players  including Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentinas Lionel Messi  have descended on Russia to play on soccers biggest stage. Its a tournament where legends are born, hearts are broken, and, when all is said and done, a team is crowned the   champion: the pinnacle of the worlds most popular sport. At least  half the world  will tune in to the competition, even if  most Americans probably wont . Thats in part because the US national team didnt qualify, but thats not the whole story. Ahead of the last World Cup in 2014, which featured Team USA,  87 percent of Americans  said they knew little to nothing about soccer, and around   had no plans to watch. Heres my plea: Continue to watch the World Cup even without the US in it. I bet youll start to enjoy soccer and the tournament as the rest of the world does. Soccer is the working mans ballet, Simon Kuper, co-author of   which was updated for this World Cup, told me. You can see beauty and genius right away. Its hard to appreciate the genius of Einstein, but one can easily appreciate the beauty of Messi. If youre on the fence about whether to tune in, in part because you dont know much about the World Cup, dont worry. What follows is a guide that helps answer all the most embarrassing questions you wouldnt want to ask out loud. At least, thats the goal (get it?). Lets get this ball rolling. 1) What is the World Cup, and how does it work? Simply put, the World Cup is the single most beloved sporting event on the planet. The World Cup brings together the most people on the globe, Grant Wahl, the author of  Masters of Modern Soccer , told me. More countries care about this sport and this tournament than any other event. The first World Cup took place in  Uruguay in 1930  after soccer became a popular event at the Olympics.  , soccers governing body (more on this group below), wanted to stage an international competition where professionals  instead of amateurs at the Olympics  could play and draw big crowds. It has since turned into a global phenomenon that enthralls soccer fans every four years. It is the  worlds most-watched sporting event  and generates billions of dollars from sponsorships, ticket and shirt sales, broadcasting licenses, and much more. (Top) Uruguay scores a goal during the first FIFA World Cup against Argentina in Montevideo, Uruguay on July 30, 1930. (Bottom) Germany scores against France during the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  Allsport/Hulton; Matthias Hangst/Getty Images Heres how the World Cup works: All the worlds  207 national teams  are split up into  . Over a roughly two-year period, they compete in regional qualifying tournaments to earn one of the 32 spots at the World Cup. The host of the tournament  in this case,    receives an automatic spot, even if it doesnt have a particularly good squad. (Sorry, Putin.) FIFA gives regions with  more and better national teams  a greater number of spots. Thats why the tournament will feature fewer teams from Asia or Africa, for example,  The qualifying 32 teams are then put into  eight groups of four   labeled Groups A through H  by a random, though seeded, draw. After the draw, the group that is deemed the hardest to win, meaning that all four teams are fairly evenly matched, is called the Group of Death. This year, however, there is   as to which one deserves that title. Once the group stage begins, the teams compete in a round-robin format, where each country plays the other three in the group just once. A win is worth 3 points; a tie, 1 point; and a loss, 0. The two teams with the highest point totals at the end of those three games move on to the knockout rounds.  Thats when the World Cup gets really fun  and soccer fans blood pressure rises to unhealthy levels. In the group stage, a team could tie a game, or even lose, but still play on. But in the knockout rounds, the losing team is eliminated from the entire tournament while the winner goes to the next round.  Recall that soccer has two halves, each 45 minutes long, for a total of a 90-minute game (plus   for injuries and substitutions, at the referees discretion). If the scores are tied at the end of those 90 minutes, the knockout game goes into a 30-minute overtime; if both sides remain tied after that, they go to penalty kicks.  The win-or-go-home nature of the knockout rounds makes every pass, every slide tackle, every save, and, yes, every goal matter even more. Theres a round of 16, which then turns into a quarterfinal, which becomes a semifinal, ultimately leading to the biggest game in all of soccerdom: the World Cup final. Its like Game 7 of the World Series and the Super Bowl all rolled into one, but the entire world cares about it. You can tell how much winning the final means to players and fans just from  s celebrations after it won the last World Cup in 2014. The country held a   when the players returned home.

Alex Grimm/Bongarts/Getty Images (Quick note: The losers of the two semifinal games play each other before the final to determine who comes in third place. Its technically part of the tournament, but its more about making the almost-finalists feel good, I guess.) 2) Where is the 2018 World Cup? FIFA, world soccers governing body, chooses where it will hold its quadrennial flagship tournament based on bids (and maybe some bribes) from countries. In December 2010, it made a startling decision:  Russia would host the 2018 competition . (It also tapped Qatar for the 2022 tournament, but more on that later.) That was somewhat surprising;   angling for the tournament included a joint Belgium-Netherlands bid, a solo England bid, and a joint Portugal-Spain bid. At the time, those options seemed more attractive to soccer fans because, well, they have great soccer facilities and cultures  and are also not run by an autocrat like Vladimir Putin.  Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff conducts the official hand over of the FIFA World Cup from Brazil to Russia with President Vladimir Putin and FIFA President Joseph Sepp Blatter.  Alexander Hassenstein; FIFA/Getty Images There were some irregularities with the vote. A member of Russias World Cup lobbying group sent a   to a FIFA executive, for example. And three weeks before the tally, news broke that  FIFA had suspended two voting members for accepting bribes  in exchange for votes. However, a commissioned FIFA report cleared Russia of any  Awarding authoritarian countries with top global sporting events is actually a trend. As my colleague Zeeshan Aleem pointed out, fewer countries now want to host the   because of how costly it is. But dictatorships that dont have to worry about financial accountability to citizens remain interested in hosting big sporting competitions. The same is true for the World Cup. The World Cup became very overpriced, said Kuper, who is also a columnist for the Financial Times. He noted that   upped the ante when it hosted in 2006 by having top-of-the-line stadiums and facilities, spending roughly   to host the competition.  There were other instances of countries going all out to win the bid. In 2002, South Korea and Japan  built 16 total stadiums, and refurbished four others , to host the tournament. Brazil spent around   to host the 2014 competition. That upped the ante for hosting the 2018 World Cup. So far, it looks like Russia has reportedly spent  wait for it    total to host the World Cup, with nearly 60 percent of that money coming from the countrys federal budget. That massive spending total includes building the  Krestovsky Stadium in St. Petersburg . It cost about $1 billion, seats around 70,000 fans, and is now the second-largest stadium in the country. As you might imagine with a project like this  and because its Russia  there was a lot of corruption surrounding the stadiums creation. One prominent example: A Russian deputy governor received around  50 million rubles, or $800,000 , in kickbacks from the subcontractor who built the scoreboard. Its a systemic problem. You cant build something legally, safely and sensibly in Russia without constant cost overruns, corruption, and mismanagement, Lyubov Sobol, a researcher at the anti-Putin Foundation for Fighting Corruption, told the   in 2016. But FIFA likely wont mind. Russia (and Qatar) effectively told the organization, Look, whatever you want, well spend the money  we dont care because were not accountable, really, to our population, Kuper told me. Having lavish facilities, frankly, makes the World Cup aesthetically pleasing, which in turn reflects well on Russia and FIFA. Heres one thing that might make both Russia and FIFA look bad, though: Russias notorious hooliganism. There is currently a disturbing rise in  neo-Nazi soccer fans  in Russia. During a European soccer tournament in the summer of 2016,  Russians attacked English fans   cutting one persons Achilles heel and lodging glass into another persons neck. A Russian soccer fan holds up flares during the UEFA EURO 2016 match between England and Russia at Stade Velodrome on June 11, 2016 in Marseille, France. Ian MacNicol/Getty Images It was like nothing Ive ever seen before, a British police officer  told Sky News . The Russians came with serious intent to carry out barbaric violence. They were highly organized, very effective. We saw football hooliganism on a different level. Russian soccer fans are also known for their rampant  . FIFA even fined Russia around $30,000 in early May for failing to stop bigoted chants from supporters during a game against France. (The French team has a lot of black players.) So the World Cup may look aesthetically pleasing thanks to Putins heavy spending, but the Russian fans could make the tournament look really ugly. 3) What is FIFA? Weve talked a lot already about this soccer governing body known as FIFA. What the heck is it, and why is the World Cup called the   World Cup, anyway? FIFA stands for the  Federation Internationale de Football Association . Its the soccer organization that runs the World Cup and has a super-French name because, well, it was  founded in Paris in May 1904 . It runs other big tournaments worldwide too, but the World Cup is its main showpiece.  Its best to think of FIFA as the global administrative hub of soccer that aims to regulate and promote the sport worldwide. Oddly, it runs like an actual global political body. It has a   who leads the entire organization, a   that passes dictates for the game, and even   that provide strategic guidance and oversight. FIFA is also made up of six semiautonomous regional bodies that help govern their respective areas. These regional bodies administrate all things soccer for their areas, including the six different qualifying tournaments for the World Cup. Soccer in the United States, for example, is governed by the the Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football  known more commonly as  Like most large international bodies, FIFA has had its share of major scandals. Heres the most recent big one: In 2015, the  US Department of Justice  indicted nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives for racketeering conspiracy, money laundering, and wire fraud as part of a 24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer. Its worth noting that FIFA is technically a nonprofit, even though it makes billions of dollars.  Attorney General Loretta Lynch enters a news conference at the U.S. Attorneys Office of the Eastern District of New York, preparing to speak after the arrests FIFA officials for racketeering, bribery, money laundering and fraud on May 27, 2015. Spencer Platt/Getty Images Two charged members included  , then the president of CONCACAF, and  Juan Angel Napout , formerly the South American regions chief. The scandal eventually led  , then the head of FIFA, to resign. FIFAs corruption has caused some prominent soccer fans to wrestle with their love of the World Cup. Look no further than  : In 2014, he worked through his conflicting anti-FIFA and pro-World Cup feelings during the early days of his show  Last Week Tonight Its worth your time to watch, if for no other reason than youre going to need a laugh before the next section. 4) Is the USA in the World Cup 2018? If youre not sitting down while you read this, grab a seat. Its about to get rough. Heres really all you need to know: America didnt qualify for the tournament, even though it should have. (The womens national team, it should be noted, is the  best in the world  and won the last  Womens World Cup in 2015 The US, like every other country, went through regional qualifying in order to make the World Cup. The United States, because its in North America, competes in CONCACAF. There are multiple rounds in CONCACAFs qualifying tournament, but the fifth and final one sees the six best teams compete in whats called the   known colloquially as the Hex. In that round, each team plays the others twice  home and away  for a total of 10 games. The top three teams with the highest point total automatically make it to the World Cup, while the fourth-place team has to go into a playoff with an Asian runner-up to qualify. (Again, a win gets a team 3 points; a tie earns 1 point; a loss means a team receives no points.) The United States made it to the Hexagonal. That meant America had to place among the top four teams in a group consisting of Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago to make it into the World Cup. As you can tell from the results list below, the United States didnt perform well in the round. It lost its first two games against Mexico and Costa Rica, and then struggled mightily to work its way back into the fold. The 10 games in which the US mens national team competed in during the Hexagonal to make it to the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. Screenshot from US Soccer Ultimately, the US ended up in fifth place after a disastrous 2-1 loss to  Trinidad and Tobago  in the final game on October 20, 2017. But had America won, the team would be at the World Cup. That, in a nutshell, is the tragedy. Trinidad was by far the worst team in the group and  hadnt won any of its previous nine matches   with the US beating Trinidad 2-0 about four months earlier. Players Michael Bradley (left) and Christian Pulisic of the United States mens national team after their loss against Trinidad and Tobago during the FIFA World Cup Qualifier match on October 10, 2017.  Ashley Allen/Getty Images Whats worse,  Panama and Honduras  had to respectively beat Costa Rica and Mexico, the two best teams in the Hexagonal, to knock out the US if it lost to Trindad. And, of course, thats exactly what happened. That meant Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama would automatically qualify, leaving Honduras to play Australia for a World Cup spot (Australia won, knocking out Honduras). Final standings of the Hexagonal, the final qualifying round for North, Central, and Caribbean soccer teams to make it to the 2018 World Cup. Screenshot from Major League Soccer Lets be clear: The United States is by no means a world soccer power, but it is a major force within its own region alongside Mexico and Costa Rica. America had played in  every World Cup since 1990 , often comfortably making it into the tournament through the regional qualifier. But now you wont see the United States in Russia because of its tragically poor performance. It was one of the greatest failures in the history of American sports, Wahl, who also writes about soccer for Sports Illustrated, told me. There are tons of rants from former US soccer professionals about what happened. I particularly recommend this one from  , a Team USA legend who now serves as an analyst for Fox Sports 1. Lets just say he speaks for me as he goes off on how poorly the US played throughout the Hex. 5) Whos favored to win the World Cup? If you follow soccer, the tournament favorites wont surprise you: Based on  soccer mathematician David Sumpters model , they are (in order) Germany, Brazil, France, Spain, and Argentina. That makes sense: All those teams are ridiculously stacked with talent, and each has won  at least one World Cup There are good reasons to think those countries will perform well.   won the last World Cup in 2014, and many of the same players from that squad are back for 2018.   has won five World Cups  the most in history  and features one of the worlds best players in  . Brazil is also arguably the most complete team in the tournament.   Defensive midfielder Christoph Kramer holds the World Cup trophy in front of the press after Germany defeated Argentina to win the 2014 FIFA World Cup.  Matthias Hangst/Getty Images  is a perennial world soccer power and conceivably has one of the easiest paths to the final, especially since it was placed in a relatively easy group with Peru, Denmark, and Australia.   won the World Cup in 2010 and is full of wily tournament veterans that know how to win.  remains one of the worlds best teams, and its captain,  , is arguably the best soccer player to ever live. But each of these teams has its problems that could keep them from glory.  Germany, for example, has a new crop of   that still dont mesh well with the older players who lifted the last trophy. Brazil underperformed in the last tournament, even though the competition took place in Brazil. The team embarrassingly crashed out with a  7-1 loss to Germany  in the semifinals and now seeks redemption. France was riddled with personality clashes in the past and lately has failed to rise to the big occasion, Wahl told me. For example, France made it to the finals of the European championship two years ago, but  lost 1-0 to an inferior Portugal side Spains best players  primarily midfielder    are quite old and there are questions about who, exactly, will score goals for the team. And finally, Argentina has lost  four straight finals in major competitions , including falling to Germany in the last World Cup.   Of course, there are still other great teams in the tournament like Belgium, Croatia, and Uruguay. With so many talented squads vying for the top prize, this could be a World Cup to remember. 6) Who are the best players at the World Cup? Theres no way to do an exhaustive list here, as there are too many top players at the World Cup to count. Still, its worth mentioning a few names. All lists like this must start with Portugals   and Argentinas  . One of these two players have won the Ballon dOr  the worlds best player award  every year since 2008, each earning the title five times. (In 2007, Ronaldo was named the second-best player in the world, and Messi third.) Crucially, neither player has won a World Cup, hurting each mans chances of being considered the best player in soccer history. Messi came the closest after leading Argentina to a World Cup final in 2014, but ultimately  lost to Germany . Ronaldo, at least,  won the European championship in 2016  with Portugal. But there are other world-class players in this tournament. Brazils   is seen as the heir apparent to Ronaldo and Messi, angling to snatch the worlds best player award from them soon (he was named the worlds third-best player in 2015 and 2017). Frances   was 2016s third-best player and could potentially lead his country to World Cup glory. Christiano Ronaldo (top left), Lionel Messi (right), and Neymar.  Phil Walter; Marcelo Endelli; Stu Forster/Getty Images  is arguably the best midfielder on the planet even at 34 years old. This will be his last World Cup, though, and hell surely want to win a second trophy before he retires from international competition. But Belgiums  Kevin De Bruyne  will want to prove that hes the new creative force on the global stage. Whats also fun is that every World Cup heralds the global discovery of relative unknowns because of how well they play. In 2014, for example, Colombias   surprised global soccer by netting six goals, earning him a coveted place at the soccer giant Real Madrid after the tournament.  Heres who could become this years Rodriguez: Egypts   had a record-breaking season playing for Liverpool in England, and nearly singlehandedly led his team to the World Cup for the first time since 1990. Hes arguably already an elite player. Thats all the more special because he comes from the Middle East, a region that rarely produces top talent.  Frances 19-year-old   is shockingly talented for someone so young. He could use the World Cup to show that his prodigious gifts are for real and help lead his team to a title. Finally, Swedens   is a very skilled midfielder who has already made a name for himself playing in Germany. The problem is world recognition has eluded him and he has yet to become a household name. That could all change with a string of great performances if he helps his team beat expectations and go far into the knockout rounds. Kylian Mbappe of France (left) and Emil Forsberg of Sweden.  Catherine Steenkeste; TF-Images/Getty Images Dont forget the goalkeepers! No, they wont strike wonder goals, but they could stop them with miraculous, lightning-quick reflexes and acrobatic dives. Five keepers in particular stand out among the talented throng: Germanys  , Spains  David De Gea , Costa Ricas  , Frances  , and Belgiums  . You can expect these goalies to make game-winning saves when it matters most. 7) Is there an official World Cup song? This years is called  Live It Up,  and its performed by Nicky Jam, Era Istrefi, and  I cant believe Im typing this  West Philadelphia-born-and-raised Will Smith. The song was produced by Diplo, the mastermind behind some  Take a listen:  Its undoubtedly a catchy jam, but that hasnt stopped a controversy from brewing about a World Cup song. One of the major critiques is that the song has, as some have argued, a  Latin American feel.  That vibe, critics on social media say, doesnt make much sense since the 2018 World Cup takes place in Russia. Thats led some to wonder why a Russian group  or at least an Eastern European musician  didnt take the lead on the anthem (though Istrefi is from Kosovo). Lets be real: A World Cup song hasnt been a perfect representation of the host country since 1994. Thats when Daryl Hall (sans Oates) performed   for the competition held in the US.  In 1998, FIFA gave the World Cup song,  Cup of Life,  to Puerto Ricos Ricky Martin, even though the tournament took place in France. (I wouldve preferred  Livin La Vida Loca, And when South Africa held the tournament in 2010  the first time an African country hosted the competition  the song  Waka Waka (Time for Africa)  was performed by ... Shakira. (There are more examples, like when   sang the song for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil  yes, really  but you get the idea.) Many people wanted an   to sing the 2010 tournaments official song instead of the Colombian pop star. But Kyla-Rose Smith, a member of the South African band  , didnt think FIFA choosing Shakira was such a big deal.  I think that the World Cup is a global event but its also a business, a huge marketing exercise, she told   in 2010. FIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the different kinds of people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup. So I understand the choice of someone like Shakira. (Freshlyground did get to perform in the background for Waka Waka.) FIFA eventually offered some music slots to African artists, like Somali hip-hop star   (a personal favorite of yours truly), as part of its sponsored music content. But its likely the official World Cup song will stir up controversy every four years until FIFA chooses an artist that better represents that competitions host nation.  You can hear snippets of  every official World Cup song  since 1982 here: 8) Where will the 2022 World Cup take place? Qatar. Yes, you read that right: Qatar. In 2010, FIFA awarded the  2022 World Cup  to the tiny Middle Eastern nation, the first time a Mideast country will host the tournament. Thats noteworthy, but the Qatar selection has become a major controversy. Qatar is an extremely authoritarian country that subjugates women and others based on their sexual or gender orientations, according to  Human Rights Watch . The countrys human rights deficit extends into how it mistreats   who are literally building the subsequent World Cup facilities.  relies heavily on those laborers, which comprise about  95 percent of the total workforce, or 2 million people . Most come from places like Asia or Africa and  work nearly 12 hours day and live in terrible conditions A 2013 report from the International Trade Union Commission estimated that  4,000 migrant workers would die  between 2014 and the 2022 World Cup. Whether the cause of death is labelled a work accident, heart attack (brought on by the life-threatening effects of heat stress) or diseases from squalid living conditions, the root cause is the same  working conditions, the report concluded, using data from the Indian and Nepalese embassies. Part of the problem is that the country is extremely hot and typically reaches temperatures above  . That puts  thousands of workers  in life-threatening heat as they race to prepare facilities for the 2022 competition. An undated artists rendering of what a 2022 Qatar World Cup stadium will look like. 2022 Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy via Getty Images The Qatari summer heat is so bad that FIFA moved the World Cup to the winter, setting the final match for  December 18, 2022 , Qatars National Day. Thats a huge deal: All modern World Cups take place in the summer, in part so the event doesnt interfere with regular season schedules for professional soccer leagues in England, Spain, or elsewhere. Thats not all: FIFA president Gianni Infantino wants to expand the tournament to include  , 16 more than will compete in the 2018 World Cup. I firmly believe in an enlargement because I am convinced that it is good for the development of football, he told the   in April. That may be true, but it would certainly be good for FIFAs wallet. Having that many teams, though, would be a problem for Qatar. After all, its a very tiny country and is already struggling to have everything ready for 32 teams in 2022. If Qatar has to host 48 squads, it would likely exceed its capacity. Thats why theres some talk of asking   to co-host the competition. Kuwait, for now, seems interested. Theres nice symbolism in having the World Cup take place in the Middle East for the first time ever. But you have to wonder: Is giving the honor to Qatar really worth it? 9) Okay, so who will win World Cup 2018? So after all that, whos going to win, you ask. Well, I obviously dont know, but Im going to choose France.  Heres why: France is in an easy group (Group C), and should  should  comfortably finish in first place. That means it would meet the runner-up of Group D in the round of 16, which I believe will be Croatia. Croatia is a very solid team, but France has the firepower to get past them. In the quarterfinals, I believe France will play either Uruguay or Portugal (if pressed, Id say Uruguay). France should dispatch either of those talented squads too. That takes the French team to the semifinals, where I think they will face off against Belgium, one of the strongest teams in the tournament. That would be quite the heavyweight fight, but I think France has a bit more experience and quality than the still-young Belgian side, as talented as it is. Frances team during an international friendly match against Russia at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis on March 29, 2016.  FRANCK FIFE/AFP/Getty Images Some eagle-eyed readers will ask why I think France wont play Brazil, a top favorite, in the semifinals. Well, I have Brazil winning its group but losing to my projected Group F runner-up Mexico in a stunning upset. (Hey, you have to live a little with these brackets!) But if its Brazil and France in the semifinals, France still has a good shot of pulling out a win. Beating Belgium would pit France against Germany  the reigning champions  in the final (in my bracket, at least). I think France ekes out a win there against a tiring German squad, wresting the trophy away from Berlin. Recall that  France beat Germany 2-0  in the European Championships semifinal in 2016, and it might pull off similar magic again. Of course, theres a really good chance Im wrong on a lot, or all, of the above. But you have to live dangerously sometimes, and Im doing so by picking Spains archrival to win it all. My mom, a die-hard Spanish citizen and fan, has probably just disowned me. (Sorry, Mom!) My sister-in-law, who loves the French squad, hopefully thinks Im cool now. Meanwhile, my wife  who already cant wait for World Cup month to be over  likely has her head deep in her hands. Still, shell root for Germany just to spite me. I should say this: In my heart, I want Spain to win and for    the smallest nation ever to play at the World Cup that is already one of the tournaments best stories  to go deep in the competition. But Im trying to be as levelheaded as a huge soccer fan can be when thinking about the World Cup. Once the whistle blows, all debates and subplots subside. At that point, you just have to sit back, watch, cheer, and enjoy the beautiful game. A view of a 2014 FIFA World Cup game in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

{"doc": " Democracy Dies in Darkness Democracy Dies in Darkness Why calling France the last African team in the World Cup is problematic Frances Kylian Mbappe celebrates after scoring his sides third goal during its round of 16 match on June 30 against Argentina at the 2018 World Cup in Kazan, Russia. (David Vincent/AP)  Global Opinions editor, writing on international affairs and social issues Global Opinions editor July 10, 2018 at 1:34 PM EDT As a half-Ghanaian, half-Nigerian woman born in the United States, I have found it painful to watch yet another World Cup in which Africa has fallen short. The games have been especially frustrating (and not just because Ghanas Black Stars failed to qualify for the tournament): This years World Cup marks the  first time since 1982  that no African team has advanced to the knockout stages. Nigeria was defeated by Argentina. Senegal was sent home despite having the same win-loss record as Japan; the team accumulated more yellow cards than Japan and thus  became the first team in history  to be sent home from the World Cup due to the fair-play rule. At this rate, maybe Africans will have to settle for fantasizing about a Wakandan World Cup victory. But wait! World Cup fans have been jubilantly saying France is the last African team left in the World Cup. As Khaled A. Beydoun  wrote for the Undefeated , a divided nation in search of an elusive optimism puts its hope in the hands of players named Mbappe, Dembele, Fakir, Rami, Umtiti, who wear French Bleu but also play for Africa, and the legions of African soccer fans who share their continental roots. Out of 23 players, 12 have African ancestry. I confess to having extremely mixed feelings about calling France an African team. I do share in the #RootingForEverybodyBlack sentiment. Kylian Mbappe is an absolutely phenomenal player, at only 19 years old. Still, by this logic, shouldnt we black folks have been rooting for Latin American teams such as Panama, Colombia and Brazil  all teams that boast Afro-Latino players? But trust me, I get it. There is a certain glee that comes with knowing that racists, nativists and anti-immigrant politicians in France have to contend with the fact that the World Cup hopes of Les Bleus rest on the shoulders of black African men. We celebrate when black people succeed in elite Western spaces, especially if those spaces are European. Look how we fawned over Meghan Markle and Prince Harry incorporating black church culture during the royal wedding in Britain. Or take Beyonce and Jay-Z, for example: Black audiences around the world rejoiced  last month when they released their opulent  video for Apest, which showed the couple singing about their wealth and power inside the Louvre, flanked by black dancers undulating in front of priceless works of art. Les Bleus also represent certain dark truths about being an African immigrant in the West. Often, well-meaning liberals point to extraordinary accomplishments of immigrants in order to extol the virtues of immigration and tolerance. But such efforts reinforce the notion that black immigrants have to be superhuman to be deemed worthy of belonging in a white-majority society. We have to be superheroes with the powers of Spider-Man,  capable of saving babies  dangling from balconies. We have to gain entry  into all the Ivy League schools  and earn our fair share of advanced degrees. We have to be talented enough at sports to bring home championships and international glory. But just as with those who fell head over heels for Beyonce and Jay-Zs occupation of the Louvre, the celebrations of the team risk missing an important point  that the fortunes of France and black Africa have been intertwined since the days of Francafrique. France has been black for centuries, Gregory Pierrot  writes poignantly for Africa Is a Country.  If a point must be made by way of this team, maybe it is that France should not be allowed to claim distinction and separation from Africa so casually, because France owes Africa everything. Not just the resources it continues to pillage, not just the labor force it shamelessly taps into, not just the art it appropriates as it has for centuries: France owes Africa its very soul. Indeed, Africa has literally been the piggy bank of Frances political elite. Fourteen African countries on the continent still use the CFA franc, a currency that was pegged to the French franc (now the euro)  12 of them are former French colonies . The countries that use the CFA franc are some of the poorest in the world; critics of the CFA franc  say it is an instrument of monetary repression.  Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy (who once said during a speech in Dakar, Senegal, that the African had  not yet fully entered into history ) was charged earlier this year, accused of illegally accepting campaign cash from the regime of  Libyan dictator Moammar Gaddafi   the very same Gaddafi he helped to overthrow in a military intervention in 2011 and who was later killed. French President Emmanuel Macron has taken some rhetorical steps toward acknowledging Frances historical injustices against Africa. Last year, Macron faced considerable backlash from the right wing after he acknowledged that France  committed crimes against humanity  during its colonial rule over Algeria. He has  pledged to return African artifacts  taken during colonial times back to the continent. Anyway, back to soccer. It feels bittersweet at best to call the French team African, in a time when France, which has a political obsession with colorblindness,  just moved to replace the word  race with sex in its constitution, thereby making it harder for anti-racism activists to fight systemic racism and prejudice. Police brutality against black bodies in France has made headlines over the past several years. I long for the day that corruption, underdevelopment and disorganization no longer prohibit teams from the continent from making it to the final stages of the World Cup. But until then, Ill just sit back and enjoy the rest of this years #ColonizerCup  World Cup games. Africas time will come.
