Led by coach  , France exhibited an inspiring, elegant, skillful and technically advanced offensive style of football, which was strikingly similar to their  South American counterparts Representation of multi-ethnic France The France national team has long reflected the   of the country. Already in its first decades, there were in the France national team players that were considered of non-"genuinely" French origin, being descendants of immigrants of former colonies of the  French Colonial Empire  or of European countries neighboring France. The first black player to play in the national team was   in 1931. Diagne was the son of the first African elected to the  French National Assembly . Seven years later, Diagne played on the  1938 FIFA World Cup  team that featured  , the second footballer of North African descent to play for the national team (after  Abdelkader Ben Bouali  who was selected to play against   in 1937). At the 1958 World Cup, in which France reached the semi-finals, many sons of immigrants (such as   and Bernard Chiarelli) were integral to the teams success. The tradition has since continued, with successful French players such as  Hatem Ben Arfa , and   all having either one or both of their parents foreign-born. During the 1990s, the team was widely celebrated as an example of the modern   French ideal.

In recent years, critics on the  far right of the French political spectrum  have taken issue with the proportional under-representation of ethnic white Frenchmen within the team.   politician  Jean-Marie Le Pen  protested in 1998 that the  Black, Blanc,   team that won the World Cup did not look sufficiently French. In 2002, led by Ghanaian-born  , the French team unanimously and publicly appealed to the French voting public to reject the presidential candidacy of Le Pen and, instead, return President   to office. In 2006, Le Pen resumed his criticism charging that coach Raymond Domenech had selected too many black players.  In 2005, French-Jewish conservative writer   caused controversy by punning to the Israeli newspaper   that despite its earlier slogan, "the French national team is in fact black-black-black," and also adding that, "France is made fun of all around Europe because of that."

Once in South Africa, the team did not manage to score a goal in their first two matches, leaving almost no chance of going through save an exceptional win over hosts South Africa. Thereafter, the players went on strike because of what they saw as mismanagement of the Nicolas Anelka case. Anelka had been forced to depart after a slur that leaked to the press. Players said he was misquoted, and complained of the alleged leaker from the staff, the media, and the federation. Instead of training, coach Raymond Domenech read the players petition live on television to the stunned journalists. The national teams overall impact on Frances efforts to integrate its minorities and come to terms with its colonial past has been mixed.

It was the countrys first meeting with its former colony, with whom it had fought a  war from 1954 to 1962 , and it proved controversial. Frances national anthem,  , was booed by Algerian supporters before the game, and following a French goal that made the score 41 in the second half, spectators ran onto the field of play, which caused play to be suspended. It was never resumed. In April 2011, the French investigative website Mediapart released a story which claimed that the FFF had been attempting to secretly put in place a quota system in order to limit the number of dual-citizenship players in its national academies. Quoting a senior figure in the FFF, the organization was said to have wanted to set a cap of 30% on the number of players of dual-nationality by limiting places in the academies in the 1213 age bracket.  The FFF responded by releasing a public statement on its website denying the report, stating, "[N]one of its elected bodies has been validated, or even contemplated a policy of quotas for the recruitment of its training centers."  The FFF also announced that it had authorized a full investigation into the matter and, as a result, suspended National Technical Director Francois Blaquart pending the outcome of the investigation.  Former national team player   said of the allegations, "Initially I thought this was a joke. Im so stunned I dont know what to say," while   declared that comments allegedly made by manager Laurent Blanc at the meeting were "serious and scandalous". The   also weighed in on the issue, as then President   was quoted as being "viscerally opposed to any form of quota", while adding "setting quotas would be the end of the Republic".
