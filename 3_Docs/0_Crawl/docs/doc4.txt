              Introduction & Quick Facts Founding of Apple NeXT and Pixar Written By:  Last Updated:  Feb 20, 2020 See Article History Steven Paul Jobs , in full  Steven Paul Jobs ,  (born February 24, 1955,  , U.S.—died October 5, 2011,  , California), cofounder of Apple Computer, Inc. (now  ), and a   pioneer of the  Why is Steve Jobs significant?  Steve Jobs was a charismatic pioneer of the   era. With  , Jobs founded   in 1976 and transformed the company into a world leader in telecommunications. Widely considered a visionary and a genius, he oversaw the launch of such revolutionary products as the iPod and the iPhone.  What was Steve Jobs’s early life like?  Steve Jobs was born in 1955 and raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California. Though he was interested in engineering, his passions as a youth varied. After dropping out of  , Jobs worked as a video game designer at Atari and later went to India to experience  . In 1976 he helped launch  How did Steve Jobs die? In 2003 Jobs was diagnosed with a rare form of  , and the following year he underwent a major reconstructive surgery known as the Whipple operation. In 2009 Jobs received a liver transplant. In August 2011 he resigned as CEO of  , and two months later, at age 56, he died.  Founding of Apple Jobs was raised by adoptive parents in Cupertino, California, located in what is now known as  . Though he was interested in engineering, his passions of youth varied. He dropped out of  , in  , took a job at Atari Corporation as a   designer in early 1974, and saved enough money for a pilgrimage to   to experience  Back in Silicon Valley in the autumn of 1974, Jobs reconnected with  , a former   friend who was working for the  . When Wozniak told Jobs of his progress in designing his own computer logic board, Jobs suggested that they go into business together, which they did after Hewlett-Packard formally turned down Wozniak’s design in 1976. The  , as they called the logic board, was built in the Jobses’ family garage with money they obtained by selling Jobs’s Volkswagen minibus and Wozniak’s programmable calculator.

Jobs was one of the first   to understand that the   would appeal to a broad audience, at least if it did not appear to belong in a  junior high school  science fair. With Jobs’s encouragement, Wozniak designed an improved model, the  , complete with a keyboard, and they arranged to have a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit.

Though Jobs had long, unkempt hair and   business garb, he managed to obtain financing, distribution, and publicity for the company, Apple Computer, incorporated in 1977—the same year that the Apple II was completed. The machine was an immediate success, becoming synonymous with the boom in personal computers. In 1981 the company had a record-setting public stock offering, and in 1983 it made the quickest entrance (to that time) into the   500 list of America’s top companies. In 1983 the company recruited  , president   to be its chief executive officer (CEO) and, implicitly, Jobs’s mentor in the fine points of running a large corporation. Jobs had convinced Sculley to accept the position by challenging him: “Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?” The line was shrewdly effective, but it also revealed Jobs’s own near-messianic belief in the computer revolution.

In 1979 he led a small group of Apple engineers to a   demonstration at the  ’s Palo Alto Research Center ( ) to see how the  graphical user interface  could make computers easier to use and more efficient. Soon afterward, Jobs left the engineering team that was designing  , a business computer, to head a smaller group building a lower-cost computer. Both computers were redesigned to exploit and refine the PARC ideas, but Jobs was explicit in favouring the  , or Mac, as the new computer became known. Jobs coddled his engineers and referred to them as artists, but his style was uncompromising; at one point he demanded a redesign of an internal circuit board simply because he considered it unattractive. He would later be renowned for his insistence that the Macintosh be not merely great but “insanely great.” In January 1984 Jobs himself introduced the Macintosh in a brilliantly choreographed demonstration that was the centrepiece of an extraordinary publicity campaign. It would later be pointed to as the   of “ However, the first Macs were underpowered and expensive, and they had few   applications—all of which resulted in disappointing sales. Apple steadily improved the machine, so that it eventually became the company’s lifeblood as well as the model for all subsequent computer interfaces. But Jobs’s apparent failure to correct the problem quickly led to tensions in the company, and in 1985 Sculley convinced Apple’s board of directors to remove the company’s famous cofounder. NeXT and Pixar Jobs quickly started another firm,  NeXT Inc., designing powerful   computers for the education market. His funding partners included Texan   and Canon Inc., a Japanese electronics company. Although the NeXT computer was notable for its engineering design, it was eclipsed by less costly computers from competitors such as  Sun Microsystems, Inc.  In the early 1990s Jobs focused the company on its innovative software system,  Meanwhile, in 1986 Jobs acquired a controlling interest in  , a   firm that had been founded as a division of Lucasfilm Ltd., the production company of Hollywood movie director  . Over the following decade Jobs built Pixar into a major animation studio that, among other achievements, produced the first full-length feature film to be completely computer-animated,  , in 1995. Pixar’s public stock offering that year made Jobs, for the first time, a billionaire. He eventually sold the studio to the   in 2006.
